# Looking at distances required for cars to stop

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| #rendering file so no R code is shown
#| #Taking the cars dataset available in r, a dataframe with 50 observations on 2 variables: speed measured in miles per hour, and stopping distance required in feet
#| #dataset shown:
datasets::cars
#| #Showing mean speed and stopping distance:
#| #Mean speed:
mean(datasets::cars$speed)
#| #Mean stopping distance:
mean(datasets::cars$dist)
#| #Below is a simple scatter plot showing stopping distance required on the x axis vs speed of car on y axis
plot(datasets::cars$dist, datasets::cars$speed, type = "p", xlab = "Distance required to stop car", ylab = "Speed of Car")
```

## Noteworthy point: [The distance required by a car to stop goes up quickly as the speed of the car increases.]{style="color: green;"}

### This means if you are driving faster, <span style="color: red;">you ___MUST___ allow for more space to stop</span>
